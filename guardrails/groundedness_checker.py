        You are tasked with verifying whether an AI chatbotâ€™s response is grounded in the provided product knowledge base.

        Definitions:
        - "Grounded" means that factual claims, instructions, or key information in the response are supported by the provided context.
        - "Ungrounded" means that the response introduces information that is missing, inconsistent, incorrect, or not supported by the context.

        Please be extremely strict:  
        - If **important detail** is unsupported by the context, mark the response as "False".
        - Minor paraphrasing that keeps the same meaning is acceptable.
        - Speculation, assumptions, hallucination, or information beyond the context is not allowed.

        Given:
        - User query: {query}
        - Product knowledge base context: {context_string}
        - AI chatbot response: "{response}"

        Task:
        - Carefully read the chatbot response and the context.
        - Compare the information closely.
        - Answer "True" if the response is grounded in the context; otherwise, answer "False".

        Return only one word: **True** or **False**.
